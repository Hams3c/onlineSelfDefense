# Combatting Twitch doxxing
1. submit a local police report
2. submit a FBI report to the local office
3. Talk to Twitch's abuse line and see if they'll give you any information regarding metadata for your stream
4. start up a packet capture during your stream and see if there are any IP addresses which connect locally to your network interface
5. talk to your streaming provider and see if they can provide you the metadata for the session
6. do some osint research around the kid's handle.  i'm sure it changes, but its a start
7. potentially file a FOIA request for the information you're seeking, but that might be only for the federal govt
8. start keeping a log of the dates, times, and other info.  this can be used as evidence later
